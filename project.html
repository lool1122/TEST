<h1>Equaty vs Equality</h1>

<p>Today we will talk about about equaty and equality.</p>

<p><b><h2>Equality means everyone is treated the same, no matter there height,age or weight. For Example if you and an adult are wathching a tournament and you cant see they will give both of you something to stand on which means you will see it in a different point of view.</h2></b></p>


						
  <p><b><h2>Equaty means that everyone is treated according to thier needs. For example if you are watching a tournament with an adult and you cant see they will give only you something to stand on which means you will see it in the same point of view </h2></b></p>
